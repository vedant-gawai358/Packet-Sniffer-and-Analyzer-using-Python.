**Packet Sniffer and Analyzer**
🔍 Overview

The Packet Sniffer and Analyzer is a lightweight Python-based network monitoring tool designed to capture, analyze, and visualize network traffic in real time.
It helps users understand how data packets move through a network, what protocols are used, and whether any suspicious or unusual activities are happening.

The project is developed primarily for educational, research, and small-scale network analysis purposes. It gives students and administrators a hands-on way to study TCP/IP communication, inspect packet headers, and identify network performance or security issues — all through a simple and interactive interface.

⚙️ Key Features

🧩 Real-Time Packet Capture – Captures live network packets directly from the system interface using the Scapy library.

📦 Packet Decoding – Extracts and displays crucial packet information such as source IP, destination IP, port numbers, and protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, etc.).

🔎 Filtering Options – Filter traffic by protocol, IP address, or port number to focus on specific network behavior.

📊 Traffic Analysis and Statistics – Provides analytics such as packet count, frequency by protocol, and data size distribution.

🖥️ Interactive Dashboard – Web-based dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize network activity in real time.

🔐 Basic Anomaly Detection – Detects irregular traffic patterns that may indicate potential network threats or performance issues.

📁 Data Export – Allows saving captured packets into CSV or PCAP format for later use in other tools like Wireshark.

🧠 Educational Utility – Ideal for students learning computer networks, cybersecurity, or ethical hacking — helps visualize OSI layer communication.

🧱 System Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture divided into:

Packet Capturing Module – Handles live network capture using Scapy.

Packet Decoding and Filtering Module – Extracts details like IPs, ports, and protocols, and applies filters.

Data Storage Module – Stores captured packets temporarily for analysis (CSV/SQLite).

Visualization Module – Displays real-time insights using web dashboard and charts.

Analytics Module – Generates reports, highlights anomalies, and shows protocol usage statistics.

🚀 Workflow

The system captures live network packets from the active network interface.

Each packet is decoded to extract protocol type, source, destination, and size.

The decoded data is filtered and analyzed to detect unusual or suspicious patterns.

Analytical data (e.g., protocol frequency, IP traffic flow) is visualized on the dashboard.

Results can be stored or exported for deeper inspection or offline analysis.

🧰 Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Scapy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Socket, PyShark

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the dashboard)

Database (optional): SQLite or CSV for packet logs

Visualization Tools: Matplotlib / Plotly (Python), Chart.js (Web UI)

🖼️ Example Output

Packet capture table showing:

Source IP → Destination IP

Protocol type (TCP, UDP, HTTP, ICMP)

Port numbers and packet size

Real-time charts showing packet counts by protocol

Filtered log exports and summarized statistics

🔐 Use Cases

Network performance monitoring and optimization

Educational demonstration of packet transmission

Early detection of suspicious or abnormal traffic

Debugging and testing of client-server applications

Understanding how different network protocols interact

⚠️ Ethical Note

This tool is intended strictly for educational and authorized use.
Unauthorized packet sniffing or monitoring on networks without permission may violate privacy laws and ethical guidelines. Always use responsibly in controlled environments or with proper authorization.
